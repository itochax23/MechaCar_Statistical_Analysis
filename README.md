# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Purpose
* Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes
* Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots
* Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population
* Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers with a summary interpretation of the findings

## Deliverables
1. Linear Regression to Predict MPG
2. Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
3. T-Test on Suspension Coils
4. Design a Study Comparing the MechaCar to the Competition
