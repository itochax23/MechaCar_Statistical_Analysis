# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Purpose
* Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes
* Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots
* Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population
* Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers with a summary interpretation of the findings

## Deliverables
1. Linear Regression to Predict MPG
2. Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
3. T-Test on Suspension Coils
4. Design a Study Comparing the MechaCar to the Competition

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
* The following variables/coefficients are statistically likely to provide non-random amount of variance to the mpg model (they have a significant impact on miles/gallon on this prototype):
  * Vehicle length
  * Vehicle ground clearance
* The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero, because the p-value for this model is much smaller than 0.05. 
* This linear model predicts mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively because the model's r-squared value is approximately 71% (0.7149).
